# Smoke test: generate ONLY 2 levels for each of train / eval1 / eval2 so you can
# eyeball the RGB video + data_dynamic before committing to the full run. Same
# detached, dependency-chained pipeline as submit_all.sh, just tiny sizes.
#
# Each level still spawns exactly 10 mobs (fixed count, mixed species) and runs
# 600 frames. train/eval1 draw from the SEEN pool, eval2 from the UNSEEN pool.
