# What it touches:
#   * gym_envs/craftium  -> re-cloned from the fork branch (fresh engine+mods)
#   * .venv              -> synced; craftium is reinstalled so the NEW mods are

# What it does NOT touch:
#   * datasets/          (your generated data.npz / rgb.mp4 are safe)
#   * any of your python/toolkit code
