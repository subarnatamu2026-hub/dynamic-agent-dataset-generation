"""Guided navigation controller for Craftium dataset generation.

Instead of a purely random policy (which stares at the sky, wanders into caves
and rarely faces the mobs), this reads the live per-frame mob + player state that
the `dynamic_agents` mod writes to
    <run_dir>/worlds/<world>/data_dynamic.jsonl
and steers the player so that, over the episode, it turns toward and approaches
each dynamic agent in turn, keeping them in frame. Movement/look are emitted as
ordinary discrete actions (same ones the loop records), so the (obs, action,
obs') transitions stay physically consistent for world-model training.

Everything is computed in Minetest NATIVE coordinates (x=East, y=Up, z=North)
because the log stores player and mobs in that same frame on the same line, so no
frame conversion (and no chance of a frame-mismatch bug) is needed here.

The mouse turn/pitch sign convention is auto-calibrated at runtime by watching
whether a commanded turn actually moved yaw/pitch the intended way, so the
controller is robust regardless of the engine's sign conventions.
